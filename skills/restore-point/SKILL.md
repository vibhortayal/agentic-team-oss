# Restore points

A newcomer is often afraid to break things. A restore point is a saved version of the app they can always go back to, like the version history in a shared document. Going back never deletes anything: it is a new change that makes the app match the old version, checked like any other.

## Save one

Right after the owner merges a change into `main`, tag the merge commit:

```bash
git tag -a "restore/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-<issue>-<slug>" <merge-commit> -m "<one plain sentence: what the app could do at this point>"
git push origin "restore/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-<issue>-<slug>"
```

The message is for the owner, so write it as they'd say it: "Grocery list with sign-in, before the budget feature." Never move or delete a tag. A tag is not a commit, so this needs no PR.

## List them

When the owner asks what they can go back to, run `git tag -l 'restore/*' -n1 --sort=-creatordate` and show the latest five as a short list: date, the sentence, and what changed since. Offer older ones if they ask.

## Go back

1. **Say what will happen first,** in plain words: which features disappear, that nothing is deleted for good, and that it can be undone the same way. **Saved data is not rolled back.** Lists, accounts and uploads people added stay as they are. If the old version can't read data saved since, say so and stop until the owner decides.
2. **If the live app is broken right now,** the first step is Otto's rollback of the deploy (the production playbook's "roll back first" rule). This skill is for the code, which takes longer.
3. **Open an issue** "Go back to <restore point>" and hand it to Priya. Its one-line criterion: the app's files match the tag, and the team's records (`docs/`, `budget/`, `reports/`, `verification/`) stay as they are now.
4. Ian makes the change as one new commit on a ticket branch, never by resetting or force-pushing `main`:

   ```bash
   git restore --source=<tag> --staged --worktree -- . ':!docs' ':!budget' ':!reports' ':!verification'
   git commit -m "Go back to <tag>"
   ```

   This brings back the tagged files and removes files added since, while the team's records stay. Vera checks that `git diff <tag> HEAD` shows only team records, then runs the smoke checks and the share check.
5. If the range changed tests, gate files or a red zone, the tamper guard asks for the owner's labels. Walk them through it with the `explain-a-step` skill, naming what each label approves.
6. The owner tries the preview and merges, as with any change. Then save a new restore point for it.
